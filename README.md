# visualEPR
# - a multi format spectra viewer, simulator and converter for EPR data

VisualEPR is a program designed for reading, displaying, and converting a wide range of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra formats. The program provides various options for processing and analyzing EPR spectra, including baseline correction, smoothing, noise reduction, and integral/derivation options. The program supports different input formats, including ASCII, BES3T, PAR/SPC, JEOL, MAGNETTECH (.XML), ADANI (.JSON), and .CSV, and provides a frequency adjustment option for ASCII format. The program also allows for 2D spectra visualization and overlap/panorama options. Additionally, the program provides simulation options, such as stick spectrum, and Lorentzian/Gaussian functions. Spectrum export options are available in PNG and SVG formats, while data can be exported in .CSV format. This program addresses the reproducibility crisis in EPR research and enables the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principle by promoting the reusability of old data, sharing, and better documentation of published data.
